To install OpenCV, type in command prompt 

pip install opencv-python
I have tried various ways to install dlib on Windows but the easiest of all of them is via Anaconda. First, install Anaconda (here is a guide to install it) and then use this command in your command prompt:

conda install -c conda-forge dlib
Next to install face_recognition, type in command prompt

pip install face_recognition
Now that we have all the dependencies installed, let us start coding. We will have to create three files, one will take our dataset and extract face embedding for each face using dlib. Next, we will save these embedding in a file.


open anaconda prompt and then run these command again then do python feed.py etc to run file...
